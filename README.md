## Description

With nearly GBP100M in annual revenue, Adventure Hardware Group (AHG) is one of the biggest
global manufacturers of bikes and bike accessories in America, Europe and Asia. Overall, Data is
seen as the fuel for strategic engine of this organisation. AHG has recently engaged Kernel
Decision Science Limited to help it develop a data architecture that will enable it to leverage all
data assets across the organisation and regions. More recently, AHG has developed an ambition
to leverage data from weather, climate change, Google search trends, Twitter and Facebook to
understand correlations between business decisions, external forces and company performance.
Kernel recommends that an integration of all traditional and digital data sources will deliver higher
commercial value and strategic opportunities to help AHG take new markets and develop better
and more relevant products for existing and new customers.

collaboratively with other analysts and business leaders within Kernel to develop this Big Data
solution.
